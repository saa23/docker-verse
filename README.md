- Docker Container

```
For example:
```
docker pull metabase/metabase:latest
```
### run an image
```
docker run [OPTIONS] -p <PORT-HOST>:<PORT-CONTAINER> --name <IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG>
```
For example:
```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase:v0.46.4
```
options *-d*(detached mode) means the running command is executed on background.

### check active or stopped containers
check only active containers
```
docker ps
```
check all containers (run and stopped)
```
docker ps -a
```
### start or stopped containers

```
docker start <CONTAINER-ID>
```
stop a container
```
